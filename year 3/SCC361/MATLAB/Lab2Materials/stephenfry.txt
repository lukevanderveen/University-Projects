@OfficialPDC Hmm - tempted to apply I must say …
"mummified Basel woman … the great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother of UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson." Tush BBC, do the maths: Not THE "great great great…etc." but just ONE of 256 g-g-g-g-g-g-grandmothers. https://t.co/yP7RXCo31v

@_recklesslife_ I think perhaps you may be the lost one here. To say one is sorry is to express a feeling of sorrow. Such sorrow may spring from remorse or guilt, but certainly not always. The word by no means connotes culpability. For example "I am sorry you tweeted" is a fair statement, no?

How @PhilTaylor can take himself out of the moment and waste his time with silly interactions with friends in the crowd just before a crucial shot is more than I can comprehend. Imagine if he were focussed all the time ... #Lovethedarts
Lordy lordy lord. Double Crossed, outscored and blown away by @RobCross180 who looks to be the future of darts. My mouth had been hanging open for the last hour and a half. Stunning.
The beauty of this match is that there’s no bad outcome (unless aliens land and zap everyone with acidic custard) #Lovethedarts
Merciful heavens! I am not alone in my trousers.  #Lovethedarts
Holy moly. This is why we love it so #Lovethedarts
Wow. Simply wow. It’s as if we can see the crown moving from one brow to the other #Lovethedarts
In case you’ve ever wondered how many dartists there are called @PhilTaylor - well, the crowd @Yourallypally are here to help
You feel that @PhilTaylor needs to get what Sid called his “understacker” working from the getgo #LoveTheDarts
@Philsloers @PhilTaylor They did a version certainly…
I’ll get sentimental here. You may know @PhilTaylor has (obviously) “I got the power” as his play on. But he’s introduced always with Copland’s “Fanfare For The Common Man” - the right anthem for him and for darts. Nothing nobler.
Sometimes people ask me, with doubt in their voices and raised eyebrows, why I #Lovethedarts …watch tonight and you might get some idea. It doesn't get better than this

When one year ends and another begins I often think of T. S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding” –    Last season's fruit is eaten   And the full-fed beast shall kick the empty pail.   For last year's words belong to last year's language   And next year's words await another voice …
What we call the beginning is often the end  And to make an end is to make a beginning.  The end is where we start from.
And somehow this line seems rather apt too:-    … the conscious impotence of rage  At human folly, and the laceration  Of laughter at what ceases to amuse.    Here's to 2018

@Pott__ Orwell was surprisingly (and often shockingly) conservative about many things ... much to disagree on, but an observation is either true or it isn't. Doesn't matter who says it, or whatever else they may have said that is untrue. No?
@ThatVDOVault Unorthodoxy would be heterodoxy, I should say. Smells faintly of cider ...

I was heartbroken when I read that Xulhaz Mannan, Bangladesh’s leading voice on LGBTIQ rights was murdered for his activism. Words are powerful. I will use mine to give hope to Xulhaz’s family and to call for justice. Please join me #WriteForRights : https://t.co/I3GdSrWdMc

@InvertedSpiral David Gower too, of course …
@Appleamberuk Indeed - I tweeted about it many times when it came out. Glad to hear that Seaworld is going for a reboot - without orcas!
That Rolls Royce throwing action of @Raybar180′s is all the more amazing when you consider that he is naturally a left-hander. #SkyDarts
