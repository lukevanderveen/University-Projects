# 361: Artifical Intelligence

This module had projects that looked into AI topics such as Decision trees, Bag of words etc

## Matlab
- this is a folder filled with MATLAB based labs with taskes ranging from
- Bag of Words
- Classification
- K-NN
- Confusion Matricies
- K-Means
- Decison Trees
- Knapsack Problem
- Genetic Algorithm

  ## CW1
  - A MATLAB image classification task
  -  methodology and results can be seen in the [SCC361-CW1-Report.pdf](/SCC361-CW1/SCC361-CW1-Report.pdf)

  ## CW2
  - a MATLAB genetic algorithm task
  - a route must be drawn from 1 corner to the other that weaves through the randomly generated objects
  - this project required hyperparameter tunning and implementing distance metrics to create the best path
