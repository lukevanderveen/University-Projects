# 363: Security and Risk

This module has projects and labs that go into depth on practical uses of encryption, decryption, padding and
breaking certain encryptions

## Labs
- lab 1: basic hex xor combination
- lab 2: hex to SHA256
- lab3: encrypt, decrypt and pad using AES keys

## CW1
- this was split into 3 tasks
- CW1: create cipher text by encrypting a string, then create plain text by decrypting
- CW1_2: introduce padding and attack the AES, this is a known plain text attack, so we are trying to decipher the
  cryptography/encryption method
- CW1_3: create a hash method and then a method designed to attackt the hash (birthday attack)

## CW2
- risk analysis task, the tasks are different funcitons in the python file
- task 1: Risk modelling using proibability distubutions
- task 2: joint probability analysis
- task 3: Security control optimisation using regression and linear programming
