# 201: Databases

This module holds a database coursework aiming for highest level of normal form possible BCNF. The database structure can 
be observed in [Climb-ERdiagram.drawio.pdf](Climb-ERdiagram.drawio.pdf), which describes in detail the entity relationships
of this database.

The project uses java and SQL commands within the java files to generate this database from a string of names and assigns
and index and random atributes to each name (GenerateCSV.java).
