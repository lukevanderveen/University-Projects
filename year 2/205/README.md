# 205: Computer Networks

This project is meant to demonstrate ICMP pings, traceroutes, WebServer request handlers and Proxey servers,
however the code within each method has been lost, the actual version was saved on my uni VM, of which I no longer have 
access to. In the coursework I managed to complete the ICMPPing class task, the Traceroute task and WebServer task but
was unable to compelete the Proxey server task.
